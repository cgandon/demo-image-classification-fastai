# demo-image-classification-fastai

Purpose of this project is to test and learn about Fast.AI image recognition libraries libraries.

My colleague and I started off from this blog: 
https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/deep-learning-with-python-and-fast-ai-part-1-image-classification-with-pre-trained-model-cd9364107872

From there i tried to apply the same approach to a business usecase applicable to the company i work for
Objective is to try and classify automatically Rings. My company produces a famous ring that has 2 versions: with diamonds and without diamonds (i.e. plain ring). 

So far we have not achieved to train the model in a way that allows it to recognize whether the ring as diamonds or not.
