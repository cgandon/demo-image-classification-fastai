# demo-image-classification-fastai

Purpose of this project is to test and learn about Fast.AI image recognition libraries libraries.

My colleague and I started off from this blog: 
https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/deep-learning-with-python-and-fast-ai-part-1-image-classification-with-pre-trained-model-cd9364107872

From there i tried to apply the same approach to a business usecase applicable to the company i worked for in the past
Objective is to try and classify automatically Rings. My company produces a famous ring that has 2 versions: with diamonds and without diamonds (i.e. plain ring). We try to build an algorithm that will recognize whether the ring has diamonds or not.

So far I have not achieved it, but still working on it.
